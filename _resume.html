        <h4>ElectroCode &mdash; Website, IRC Network, Python-Based IRC Services</h4>
        <small class="prohob-duration">January 2012 - PRESENT</small>
        <p class="">First, I run a website for ElectroCode, <a class href="https://electrocode.net">https://electrocode.net</a> , as well as manage the IRCds for the related IRC network, with help from two other IRCOps (IRC Operators/Administrators).</p>
        <p class="">On several of these IRCd servers I have the ability and access to manage them directly, installing/removing software, editing server wide configuration, adding/removing users, shutdown/reboot the server, etc.</p>
        <p class="">I also have a hand in developing a Python based IRCd-like service framework; which is called PyLink, that allows the introduction of arbitrary (ro)bots to accomplish certain tasks and provide certain services to the users on the client servers.
          Some commands though, are IRCOp only, as well as some of the functions of the (ro)bots.</p>
        <p class="">Along with that, I actually run an instance of it on my IRC network. For instance, as of February 2017, I&rsquo;ve developed 3 plugins/services. First, Aurora, which requests the IRC Client Software version on the user&rsquo;s connection to the network. Second, &lsquo;Welcome&rsquo;, a simple bot that provides helpful information to users when they register a channel. Third, &lsquo;Quote&rsquo;, an IRC-based quote database, which uses MySQL, as well as a Python Library named SQLAlchemy, which allows easier ways to interact with a MySQL database. The library still requires you know the structure of a simple query though, so you do need to know the &lsquo;grammar&rsquo; and &lsquo;conventions&rsquo; of a MySQL query.</p>

        <small>September 2016 - PRESENT</small>
        <p class="">IRC-Source is a search and statistics engine for online chat rooms. My roles include, server administration/maintenance, website administration/maintenance, development of new features.</p>
        <p class="">I&rsquo;ve helped the owner with user support and &lsquo;chatroom&rsquo; questions and after a period of showing my worth, I&rsquo;ve since become one of his most trusted friends, and have earned the privilege of being an administrator to
          all of the service&rsquo;s many facets.</p>

        <p class="">In some cases I may manage social media accounts for clients. I have a quite expansive and intricate knowledge of the use of social media, as well as the marketing and presence thereof.</p>

        <h2>PyLink &mdash; Python Based Cross-IRCd Relay</h2> <small>October 2016 - PRESENT</small>
        <p class="">PyLink&rsquo;s primary and usual function is to relay and share messages, users and the like between multiple defined chat networks. The Python based IRC Services on my IRC network is built using this.</p>
