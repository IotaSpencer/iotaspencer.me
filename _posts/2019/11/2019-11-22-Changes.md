# Changes are coming!

## Internally

* All projects that are owned by me are getting their own subdomain under `iotaspencer.me`.  
  * An example being `mkmatter` which would end up being `mkmatter.iotaspencer.me` or `site_hook` being `site-hook.iotaspencer.me`. The list goes on.
  * All links to current projects will (as soon as everything is finished) point to their respective subdomains.

## Externally

* I may start to make youtube videos
  * Gaming on [IotaPlays](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvFYJhzNR8jXpACEdvL6Btg) 
  * Programming on [Iota Spencer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk2QkzGvmqO-GUzV59b_8Hw)
