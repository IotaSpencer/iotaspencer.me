# Me Stuff

## So um..

Hi, my name is Ken Spencer, if you didn't already figure that out.. I'm 26 years old and live in New York State.

I love programming and scripting, especially being able to make my own little utility scripts, whether I *really* need them or not. 'Why?' You may ask.. Because to me, coding and programming is actually fun in most circumstances, and unless I'm deeply down, programming is my goto for winding down after a hard day.
