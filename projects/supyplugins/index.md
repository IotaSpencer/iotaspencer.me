# SupyPlugins

SupyBot & Limnoria are python  based IRC bots used for many different purposes.
In the past I've made bots for..

* Opering
* Services
* Channel Management
* Fun APIs
* Utilities
* Connectors to other projects
* IRC File Tailers

Some plugins are already made, like `OperUp`{:.highlight} a plugin for making a bot `operup`{:.highlight}
While I can send in Pull Requests, not all projects are still *alive*, so I have to take matters into my own hands
and either make a new plugin, or take the previous code and change it myself.

Most of the plugins I've made that I can publicly show are housed at [IotaSpencer/supyplugins on GitHub](https://github.com/IotaSpencer/supyplugins).
