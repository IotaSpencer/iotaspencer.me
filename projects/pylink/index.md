# PyLink

## About
PyLink is a janus like python program used primarily to link different networks together. PyLink is developed primarily by [James Lu on GitHub](https://github.com/jlu5).

## Involvement

I have previously had code pulled in and have submitted a few plugins and services to the 3rd party plugins repository.

### Plugins

* Quotes
* CTCP (On connect versioner)
* Welcome (Anope Services
* Additions to the main pseudoclient for my own network, like DNS control, fun commands, and other utilities.
