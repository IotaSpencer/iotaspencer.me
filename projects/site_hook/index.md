## About

{{ page.excerpt }}

1. Any version number in #.#.z is to be considered a development or patch/bug release.
   * These are released often, almost every other day or more than once in a day.
   * Consider these unstable
   * Only use them if trying to help develop site_hook
1. Any version number in #.y.0 is to be considered a beta release
   * these are few and far between
   * released when big changes are added
     * but haven't been tested much
     * or have been tested but am unsure on other factors.
     * These may be considered stable for the most part, but may have freak bugs
1. Any version number in x.0.0 is a major release.
   * As of 03/Oct/2018, there has been no major releases, due to site_hook currently not being totally x.0.0 release worthy.
   * once all bugs pertaining to the current minor.patch version have been fixed or features added, then there may be a x.0.0 release.


**NOTE**: With a development release, when submitting a issue/bug report, please include the version number in your issue title.
