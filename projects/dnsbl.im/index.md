# DNSBL.im

## Involvement

I helped manage DNSBL.im, a DNSBL (Domain Name Service BlackList).
Myself and [Robert Whitney](https://xnite.me) had been working on it for over a year, it boasted an API and a few other tools used to help manage it.

## API

I'd been the one constructing the API, its a public DNSBL but there is restricted access to the API. It had multiple abilities, involving adding, removing and checking.
