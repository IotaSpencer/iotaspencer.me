# iotaspencer.me

[iotaspencer.me](https://iotaspencer.me) is my personal website, blog, and portfolio.

It is powered by jekyll but is built and pushed to my server, so I don't have to auto pull every time I add a post/page and less things "<i>don't work</i>"

If you'd like to see how its built and pushed, see the [bin/build_and_push.py](bin/build_and_push.py)
